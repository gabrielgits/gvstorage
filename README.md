# GvStorage

A robust and intuitive desktop application for organizing and managing digital assets compressed in ZIP format.

## About

GvStorage was conceived as a robust and intuitive desktop application, designed for individuals such as developers, designers, or advanced users who need an organized and efficient way to store and manage various digital assets compressed in ZIP format. This includes, among others, scripts, small applications, website templates, themes, and code snippets. The main goal is to eliminate the clutter of scattered files and provide a centralized library that is easily searchable and manageable.

The application aims to offer a modern and intuitive control panel that provides an immediate overview of the user's library, image gallery, description, version, and main page link. Its central objective is to simplify the lifecycle of managing these assets, from initial upload to retrieval and updating. By providing powerful tools to easily upload, download, and update content, GvStorage will act as a personal asset management system.

## Key Objectives
